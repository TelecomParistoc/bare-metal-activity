# bare-metal-activity
The source code for the bare metal activity.

## Description
The objective is to write a small practical exercise describing how to turn on a led when a button is pushed, on a STM32 Nucleo-64 development board with STM32F030R8 MCU.

It should be mostly self explanatory (or refer to the doc) since its purpose is to teach students who have never done this kind of thing.
